# Purpose
Since governments and health agencies around the world have created a huge amount of confusion about whether the #COVID19 #pandemic is over, our #Canadian #Charity has created a simple, clear, concise app that will keep you up to date on the status: https://iscovidover.ca

The tool will be kept up to date so that you can rely upon its response!

It works on mobile browsers too, so you can easily get updates on your cell phone or tablet just by visiting https://iscovidover.ca

It has a very straightforward API that you can leverage in your application.  Simply send a standard: 
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: http://iscovidover.ca
(Or HTTPS secure equivalent) and our app will give you a concise text/boolean castable response that you can parse from the HTML!

You can easily pipe the application into Google Translate to get output in your language of choice!  For example, pour une réponse en français, visitez: https://iscovidover-ca.translate.goog/?_x_tr_sl=en&_x_tr_tl=fr&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp

The Japanese translation holds up pretty well too: https://iscovidover-ca.translate.goog/?_x_tr_sl=en&_x_tr_tl=ja&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp

Last, but not least, we are working with our friends at Google Adsense to try to add in-app advertisements so that our charity can get a few ad-driven donations from the app. Right now, they've flagged it as "low value content". We're working to convince them that simplicity is best!  Updates that don't compromise the simplicity and succintness of the app but allow our charity to display ads to get some small donation revenue from Google Adsense are particularly welcome from the open source community!
